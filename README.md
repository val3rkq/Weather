# Weather App
The Weather Flutter App is a versatile and user-friendly mobile application developed with the Flutter framework. This app provides real-time weather information for any location around the world, empowering users with accurate weather forecasts and current conditions. This app has Hive Datebase. I also used HTTP-library for getting weather data from openweathermap.org.

## Features
- Real-time Weather Data: Get up-to-the-minute weather updates for any location.
- Weather Forecast: View a detailed weather forecast for the next 7 days.
- Location-based Weather: Automatically fetches weather data for your current location.
- Search: Search for weather information in any city globally.
- Customization: Set your preferred units (Celsius/Fahrenheit // m\s / km\h).
